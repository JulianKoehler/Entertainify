## My process

I was provided with the figma files by Frontendmentor.

### Built with

- React via Vite
- TypeScript
- Styled Components
- Firebase REST API

In this project I am leveraging the recent update of React Router Dom by using its createBrowserRouter API in conjunction with loaders and actions which reduces the usecases of useEffect.

### What I learned

During this project I learned a lot about authentication in generel. Since this is a dummy app which is supposed to demonstrate my skills in frontend web development I kept things simple and didn't implement a heavy backend solution but rather used the firebase REST API solution. I studied a lot of resource regarding security, how to save the token safely. In my case, I needed an easy solution to access the JWT Token on the client side since my Route Protection is checking the localStorage, if a token is existing there. For the future, I am super curious about other, more safe and industry standard solutions to this.
